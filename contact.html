            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>How long does shipping take?</h3>
            <p>Shipping times vary depending on your location. We do our best to send out zines weekly, but we are using usps first-class mail to keep costs as low as possible.</p>

            <h3>Do you ship internationally?</h3>
            <p>At this time, we do but please be aware of longer wait times and potential customs issues.</p>

            <h3>Can I request multiple zines?</h3>
            <p>You may request one copy of any of our zines. If you need or want multiple copies of one specific zine, please email us from our contact information below to discuss.</p>

            <h3>If I request multiple different zines, how will they arrive?</h3>
            <p>Each zine will be shipped individually, this is because of usps mail restrictions and cost. Once packages become larger than a single envelope our costs for this free zine increase dramatically.</p>

            <h3>Can I request tracking?</h3>
            <p>At this time, no. Tracking incurs a significant cost and we are not ready to support or handle that for such a smalltime hobby of ours.</p>

            <h3>What happens if I don't get my zine?</h3>
            <p>First, please allow up to 2-3 weeks for your zine to arrive, this is usps first class mail. If your zine does not arrive after that period, feel free to contact us and we can work to dispatch you a one time resend!</p>

            <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>Our zines are offered for free to our community within the boundaries of common sense! We retain the right to decline anyone we feel uncomfortable sending to. Please don't take advantage of our hobby and kindness.</p>
